# Kantan-Components

Kantan-Components is a lightweight React Utility Components library. The project is still work-in-progress, and the Documentation can be found [here](https://kantan-components-docs.netlify.app/).

## Get started

Run the following command

```shell
npm install kantan-components
```

Or do it with yarn:

```shell
yarn add kantan-components
```

Next, import the component that you need. Learn more in the [documentation](https://kantan-components-docs.netlify.app/docs/intro).

```jsx title/App.js
import { Tooltip } from "kantan-components";

const App = () => (
  <div>
    <Tooltip text="default position">
      <strong>Hover over.</strong>
    </Tooltip>
  </div>
);
```
